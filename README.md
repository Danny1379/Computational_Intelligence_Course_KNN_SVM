# Computational_Intelligence_Course_KNN_SVM
second computational Intelligence course homework , preprocessing , SKlearn SVM , KNN implementation
with the given dataset we were tasked with making an svm model using sklearn library and implementing KNN algorithm by hand.
The give dataset contained unknown values and values that requiered encoding and bining (such as age) , there are a number of methods that can be used to handle this dataset i 
presonally chose to remove unknown data due to time constraints and used one hot encoding for categorical data. 
A diffrent and maybe better method would have been to use data imputation like regression , i will hopefully try this out in the future.
